# Machine Learning 2 – Master's Course
### Technische Universität Berlin · Prof. Klaus-Robert Müller

This repository contains coursework from the **graduate-level Machine Learning 2** course taught by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller at Technische Universität Berlin during the Summer Semester 2022. The course is part of the Master’s in Computer Science program and builds on ML fundamentals with a focus on **Bayesian methods**, **probabilistic modeling**, and **advanced inference techniques**.

Assignments include both **theoretical exercises** and **Python implementations** of probabilistic machine learning algorithms.

## Topics Covered
The course explored probabilistic approaches to learning, covering theory and practice of inference, generative modeling, and variational techniques:

1. **Low-Dimensional Embedding** – Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
2. **Component Analysis I** – Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
3. **Component Analysis II** – Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
4. **Component Analysis III** – Autoencoders
5. **Kernel Machines I** – Structured Kernels
6. **Hidden Markov Models** – Probabilistic sequence modeling
7. **Kernel Machines II** – Structured Prediction
8. **Kernel Machines III** – Anomaly Detection
9. **Deep Learning I** – Structured Networks
10. **Deep Learning II** – Structured Prediction
11. **Deep Learning III** – Explainable AI
12. **Deep Learning IV** – Anomaly Detection

## Contents
The repository is organized into weekly folders (e.g., `Week01`, `Week02`, ...) following the course progression. Each folder typically contains:

- `Analytical_Homework.pdf` files with derivations and handwritten solutions
- `Programming_Homework.ipynb` notebooks implementing inference algorithms and generative models
