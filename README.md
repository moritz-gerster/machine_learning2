# Machine Learning 2 â€“ Master's Course
### Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin Â· Prof. Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller

This repository contains coursework from the **graduate-level Machine Learning 2** course taught by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin during the Summer Semester 2022. The course is part of the Masterâ€™s in Computer Science program and explores how machines can learn from data â€” from statistical foundations to modern AI techniques.

Assignments include both **analytical derivations** and **programming tasks**.

## Topics Covered
The course explored probabilistic approaches to learning, covering theory and practice of inference, generative modeling, and variational techniques:

1. **Low-Dimensional Embedding** â€“ Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
2. **Component Analysis I** â€“ Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
3. **Component Analysis II** â€“ Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
4. **Component Analysis III** â€“ Autoencoders
5. **Kernel Machines I** â€“ Structured Kernels
6. **Hidden Markov Models** â€“ Probabilistic sequence modeling
7. **Kernel Machines II** â€“ Structured Prediction
8. **Kernel Machines III** â€“ Anomaly Detection
9. **Deep Learning I** â€“ Structured Networks
10. **Deep Learning II** â€“ Structured Prediction
11. **Deep Learning III** â€“ Explainable AI
12. **Deep Learning IV** â€“ Anomaly Detection

## Contents
The repository is organized into weekly folders (e.g., `Week01`, `Week02`, ...) following the course progression. Each folder typically contains:

- `Analytical_Homework.pdf` files with derivations and handwritten solutions
- `Programming_Homework.ipynb` notebooks implementing inference algorithms and generative models

> This coursework is based on my own work, collaborative discussions within my homework group, and publicly provided materials. Redistribution or reuse of these materials for educational or institutional use is not permitted.
