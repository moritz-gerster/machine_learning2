The dataset is based on the dataset of the previous programming sheet on splice sites classification.

It was shown to represent genes data efficiently near the splice sites. For our completion task, we adopt a structured output learning approach, where the candidate value for replacing the missing nucleotide is also part of the kernel feature map. Interestingly, with this approach, the kernel can still apply to the same type of input data (i.e. continuous gene sequences) as in the standard splice classification setting.\n",
